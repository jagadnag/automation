## Who am I?

My name is Adam Rush and I’m a passionate pseudo-geek based in Bristol, UK.

I’ve been into computing since I was a lad.
Since then, I’ve learned something new almost every day.

I love all things IT but my main interests are in Automation (especially PowerShell), IT Infrastructure, and experimenting with new technologies.

## What is the "Hype-Pipe"?

The "Hype-Pipe" (a.k.a HyperLoop or HypeLine) is a term myself and good friend / colleague [Matt Horgan](http://matthorgan.xyz/) use to mock ourselves daily when we inevitably find ourselves "hyping" on some idea / technology / process / ANYTHING!

## What will I find on this blog?

Mainly posts about stuff I'm working on day-to-day, as I'm very forgetful and they serve as a great source of reference, but I've also learned from my [old blog](http://www.virtuallyimpossible.co.uk) that they help many others overcoming the same challenges. It's good to give back as I've learned soo much from other blogs etc.

## Anything else?

I used to study towards IT certifications as a means of structured learning, which worked really well for me and I enjoyed attaining them all, including:

- VMware VCP-Cloud / VCP5
- Microsoft MCSE / MCITP:Enterprise Administrator / SQL / Exchange
- Cisco CCNA
- Citrix CCA / CCAA

> For a full list of certificates, achievements, and work history please visit my LinkedIn profile: [https://uk.linkedin.com/in/adamrushuk](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/adamrushuk)

However, these days I prefer to take a more casual approach to learning and tend to experiment with whatever I'm hyping on in that moment.
